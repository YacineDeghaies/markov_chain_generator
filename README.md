# Basic Markov Chain Text Generator in C++

This C++ program implements a Markov Chain-based text generator. It processes an input text file and generates new text, mimicking the style of the original text based on the Markov Chain model.

## Features
- Input text processing from a file.
- New text generation using Markov Chains.
- Configurable key length and output word count.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler.
- Standard C++ libraries.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program with your C++ compiler.
2. Execute the program and enter the filename of your text file when prompted.
3. The program outputs the generated text to the console.

### Example
```bash
./markov
Enter file name: yourtextfile.txt
